## Abstract
We present _RodSteward_, a design-to-assembly system for creating furniture-scale structures composed of 3D-printed joints and precision-cut rods.  The RodSteward systems consists of: _RSDesigner_, a fabrication-aware design interface that visualizes accurate geometries during edits and identifies infeasible designs; physical fabrication of parts automatically generated 3D-printable joint geometries and cutting plans for rods; and _RSAssembler_, a guided-assembly interface that prompts the user to place parts in order while showing a focus+context visualization of the assembly in progress.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tools with a number of example constructions of varying complexity, style and parameter choices.
